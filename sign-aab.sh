#!/bin/bash
# sign-aab.sh
# Signs the unsigned AAB produced by ./build.sh aab (or workspace aab)
# and copies a clean signed AAB to the release/ folder so you can just copy it to Play Console.
#
# For internal testing on Play Store.
#
# Usage:
#   ./sign-aab.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   - keytool and jarsigner in PATH (usually from Android Studio JDK or your Java install)
#   - The AAB from a previous `./build.sh aab` (or `workspace aab`)
#
# The script will:
#   1. Find the latest unsigned app-release.aab from the dx build output.
#   2. If no upload keystore exists, generate one (upload-keystore.jks) and guide you.
#   3. Sign the AAB.
#   4. Copy the signed result to alarmfree/release/ with a timestamped name.
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit the .jks file or passwords.
#
# WHAT IF I LOSE THE PASSWORDS / KEYSTORE?
# =========================================
# This is your UPLOAD KEY (not the final app signing key, because we use
# Google Play App Signing).
#
# - Before first upload to Play Console: Just delete the .jks and generate a new one.
#   Run the script again — it will create a fresh keystore.
#
# - After the app has been uploaded + Play App Signing is enabled:
#   You can request an "upload key reset" from Google Play support.
#   See: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423
#   The process involves proving ownership. It can take days to weeks and
#   you won't be able to publish new versions during that time.
#
# STRONGLY RECOMMENDED:
# - Store the .jks file in a password manager as an attachment.
# - Store the two passwords (keystore + key) in the same password manager entry.
# - Make an encrypted backup on at least two different devices/drives.
# - Write down the alias ("upload") and the fact that it was created with 2048-bit RSA.
#
# For future releases: you MUST keep using this exact same .jks file.
# Creating a "new" keystore later (even with the same password) = different certificate
# = you will need a painful upload key reset with Google support.
#
# Losing the upload key after going live is painful but recoverable.
# Losing it before going live is basically free — just generate a new one.
